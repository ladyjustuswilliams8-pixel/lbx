"""Standard rollout scaffolding for sim_policy graders.

A sim_policy task's `compute_score` typically does the same four things:

  1. Load the held-out eval simulator from /mcp_server/data/.
  2. Load the agent's submitted policy from /tmp/output/policy.py in a
     sandboxed worker.
  3. Roll N held-out seeds: per seed, reset the sim, repeatedly query the
     policy with (obs, info), step the sim, capture per-step / per-episode
     metrics; aggregate.
  4. Reduce the aggregates to a final score via the scoring helpers.

This module wraps step (2) + (3): a single helper that loads the policy, runs
N seeds with a task-supplied per-step closure, and returns per-seed records
plus aggregate metrics. Task-specific details (the observation shape, the
action shape, the reset signature, the episode-termination criteria, the
per-episode metrics) live in two small closures the caller supplies.

The helper is deliberately thin -- it does not prescribe a fixed obs/action
interface, doesn't assume Gymnasium semantics, doesn't bake in a single
metric set. Robotics-control envs vary enough that a one-size-fits-all
interface would either be too restrictive (Gymnasium-only) or too lax (no
real abstraction at all). The author writes their own per-step closure; the
helper handles loading, the seed loop, isolated-exception fallback, and the
results dict shape.

Typical use:

    from grading.env_loading import load_env_module
    from grading.policy_eval import run_seeds, aggregate
    from grading.calibration import piecewise_linear_score, progress_higher_better

    def compute_score() -> float:
        eval_sim_mod = load_env_module("/mcp_server/data/eval_sim.py",
                                        factory_name="make_eval_sim")

        def roll_one_seed(policy, seed):
            sim = eval_sim_mod.make_eval_sim(seed=seed)
            obs = sim.reset()
            done = False
            steps = 0
            while not done and steps < MAX_STEPS:
                action = policy.act(obs, {"step": steps})
                obs, reward, done, info = sim.step(action)
                steps += 1
            return {"finished": bool(info["success"]),
                    "gates": int(info["gates"]),
                    "time": float(steps * sim.dt)}

        results = run_seeds(roll_one_seed, n_seeds=20, base_seed=10_000)
        # Floor a crashed seed at the worst legitimate value instead of
        # skipping it, so crashing hard seeds can't lift the mean:
        agg = aggregate(results["per_seed"], ["finished", "gates"],
                        failed_fill={"finished": False, "gates": 0})

    """Load the agent's submitted policy, run `roll_one_seed(policy, seed)`
    for each of `n_seeds` deterministic seeds, return per-seed records plus
    standard aggregates.

    Args:
        roll_one_seed: callable taking (policy_proxy, seed) and returning a
            mapping with per-seed metrics (e.g. {"finished": bool, "time":
            float, ...}). The callable is responsible for instantiating the
            eval sim with the given seed, looping the policy through, and
            extracting the metrics. The helper does not constrain the keys;
            whatever you return is collected verbatim into per_seed.
        n_seeds: how many seeds to roll.
        base_seed: seeds used are base_seed + i for i in range(n_seeds).
            Pick a base far from anything the agent might use during their
            own training so eval is genuinely held out.
        policy_path: path to the agent's policy file (default
            /tmp/output/policy.py). Forwarded to load_submitted_policy.
        policy_factory: name of the factory function inside policy_path
            (default "load_policy"). Forwarded to load_submitted_policy.
        policy_source: if given, load the policy from this source string
            (grader-supplied wrapper) instead of policy_path. See
            grading.policy_runner.load_submitted_policy.
        timeout_per_seed_s: optional soft wall-clock budget for one seed.
            Observed AFTER the seed completes (the helper does NOT
            preemptively kill a running seed; that would require a third
            process layer). When a seed's roll exceeds the budget, the
            helper logs a warning, sets {"soft_timeout_exceeded": True}
            on the record AND sets {"error": "soft_timeout after Xs"} so
            the record is treated as a failed seed by aggregate(skip_failed
            =True) and counted in n_failed. Rationale: a roll that ran
            past its budget almost certainly produced suspect output;
            pinning it to FLOOR is safer than averaging it in.
        on_error: "record" (default) catches Exception inside roll_one_seed
            AND inside the optional policy.reset() call, writing
            {"error": "...", "traceback": "..."} into that seed's record;
            "raise" propagates either failure. Use "record" for grading
            (a single bad seed shouldn't zero the whole run); "raise"
            during local dev to see failures fast (including broken
            reset() implementations).

    The agent's policy may optionally define `reset()`; this helper calls
    it (when present) before each seed's roll. Reset failures are governed
    by `on_error` just like roll failures.

    The submitted policy is loaded via the repo's sandboxed
    `grading.policy_runner.load_submitted_policy`, which runs the agent's
    factory in a privilege-dropped worker and raises
    `grading.faults.AgentFault` for agent-caused load failures. That
    AgentFault is deliberately NOT caught here: a failed load is a kept 0.0
    for the whole submission, distinct from a single per-seed crash.

    Returns:
        dict with:
            "per_seed":     list[dict]   one entry per seed in seed-order,
                                          with whatever keys roll_one_seed
                                          returned plus the seed itself.
                                          On any failure (raised exception,
                                          OR soft-timeout exceeded):

            "n_seeds":      int          total seeds attempted.
            "n_failed":     int          seeds with an "error" key in
